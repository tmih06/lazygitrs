- [x] commits pane overhaul
  - [x] Better graph view (enabled by default)
  - [x] Filter by branch
  - [x] Filter by commit message (handy if you prefix with ticket IDs)
- [x] ~~Command palette (OpenCode-style) — still figuring this one out~~ - It's `?`

- [x] Stash viewer:
  - Can we add the same viewer for files in the '[5] Stash' sidebar tab? (the same way we currently do with Commits tab)
- [x] Enter key in the branches sidebar tab.
  - When I press 'enter' here, it shows the 'Commits (<branch>)'. Then when I press 'enter' again it shows the 'Commit Files' (kinda similar to the [4] commits sidebar tab)
- [x] Commit item focus, what does the diff preview look like? Currently it's just plain (which kinda makes sense because there could be multiple of files in 1 commit) Expected: A nice viewer wherein I can still see the syntax highlighting, just as nice as hovering on a single file. I wonder if we can still use similar for this.
- [x] A 'Help' sort of 'which-key' feature thingy, pressing `?` would open a dialog that shows me which keys I can press in the current context. Make it also searchable i.e. pressing `/` would highlight the specific hotkey I'm looking for. Very similar to the original lazygit, just make it look better because I actually didn't like the original. i.e. The search looked too disconnected from the dialog.
- [x] Like \_tmp_lumen, I want to be able to highlight lines on the diff exploration viewing mode with my mouse.. Highlighting something would also show the same `y copy esc` tooltip just under the highlight. (no annotate since that's a lumen concept)
- [x] Like \_tmp_lumen, I want to `{}` to travel between hunks. I want `[]` to show 'old' or 'new' (so it toggle hides the side-by-side). Make sure the `[]` doesn't break the mouse interactions for highlights. I want to show the `?` help panel while focusing the 'main content diff content exploration focus' so I can see these hotkeys.
- [x] Like the original lazygit, let's have a subtab under [4] Commits, for Reflog.

- [x] More feature-parity stuff with the original lazygit... Missing features from the original lazygit (from my investigation, but I could be missing more, so add more here)
  - [x] In 'Remotes', I press `n`, prolly not implemented.
  - [x] In 'Remotes', I press `d` (delete), prolly not implemented.
  - [x] In 'Tags', I press `g` (reset), prolly not implemented.
    - [x] I noticed in the original lazygit, in the reset menu options, I see the associated command w/ it i.e.
    - Mixed reset reset --mixed f115cxxx (the 'reset --mixed f115cxxx' has a different color.)
    - Soft reset reset --soft f115cxxx
    - Hard reset reset --hard f115cxxx
  - [x] In 'Tags', I press `P`, to push tags? prolly not implemeanted.
  - [x] contextual `?` for some other pages that we haven't considered before.
    - [x] I press `?` on Remotes, I don't see much.
    - [x] I press `?` on Tags, I don't see much.
    - [x] I press `?` on Worktrees, I don't see much. It still says 'Files'
    - [x] I press `?` on Submodules, I don't see much. It still says 'Files'
  - [x] In Tags, in the original lazygit, I can:
    - [x] Press enter and see a 'commits list view'?
    - [x] after in the 'commits list view', I can press enter again and see the 'commit files' view.
    - [x] after in the 'commit files' view, I can press enter to go into 'diff exploration' (if you notice this is pretty much all standard at this point)
  - [x] In Reflog, in the original lazygit, I can:
    - [x] Press enter and it goes into 'commits list view', then if I press enter it goes into 'commit files' view, and enter again goes to 'diff exploration' (pretty standard again)
  - [x] In 'commits list view', I can press `o` to open commit in the browser.
    - Let's make this a bit different for lazygitrs. Same idea with the 'Branches' `o` key. It opens a popup for 'Open in browser' with a list of stuff I can open about this commit. So I guess 1 option is just the 'Open commit url'
    - Actually now that I realize.. We already have a `y` option for Commit url, so that's very good.
  - [x] In 'Commits list view', pressing `y` opens the 'Copy to clipboard'. Minor issue/changes:
    - [x] In the original lazygit, sometimes 'commit message body' is strikethrough'd Maybe because if it doesnt exist?
    - [x] In the original lazygit, sometimes 'commit tags' is strikethrough'd Maybe because it doesnt exist?

- [ ] For the feature-parity stuff I didn't consider in the previous todo, write it here (For AI):
  - Interactive Rebase / Commit Manipulation:
    - [ ] In 'Commits', I press `d` to drop the selected commit. Currently unimplemented.
    - [ ] Cherry-pick paste (`V`) — we have cherry-pick copy (`C`) in Commits, but no paste action to apply copied commits onto current branch.
    - [ ] In 'Commits', the original lazygit has `<c-r>` to reset cherry-pick selection.
    - [ ] Undo/Redo — the original lazygit has `z`/`<c-z>` to undo and redo git actions (using reflog under the hood).
  - Conflict Resolution:
    - [ ] Merge conflict resolution UI — the original lazygit lets you pick between versions when a merge/rebase results in conflicts.
    - [ ] Rebase conflict resolution UI — similar conflict resolution flow during interactive rebase.
    - [ ] In 'Files', the original lazygit has `M` to open merge tool / external merge tool for resolving conflicts.
  - Files:
    - [x] In 'Files', the original lazygit has `e` to open file in editor and `o` to open file in default program.
    - [x] In 'Files', the original lazygit has `<c-o>` to copy the diff of the selected file to clipboard (we have this in `y` menu, but the direct shortcut may be missing).
    - [x] Full `$EDITOR` integration — `e`/`o` now suspend the TUI for terminal editors (`hx`/`nvim`/`vim` via `editPreset` / `$EDITOR`). Commit-with-`C` (editor mode) still uses the in-app editor path.
  - Remotes:
    - [x] In 'Remotes', pressing `Enter` should drill into remote branches. Then from a remote branch: `<space>` to checkout, `M` to merge, `r` to rebase onto it, `d` to delete remote branch.
  - Submodules:
    - [x] In 'Submodules', the original lazygit has more operations: `a` to add submodule, `d` to remove submodule, `e` to enter submodule (open a nested lazygit in that submodule), `<space>` to update submodule.
  - Worktrees:
    - [x] In 'Worktrees', the original lazygit has `<space>` to switch to worktree (open it).
  - Branches:
    - [x] In 'Branches', the original lazygit shows divergence info (ahead/behind counts relative to upstream). (already implemented)
  - Done / Won't Do:
    - [x] ~~Diff mode — the original lazygit has a way to diff any two commits/branches against each other (not just viewing a single commit's diff).~~ (Author check: I have separate ideas for diff mode: comapring two commits/branches against each other, it'll be more intuitive)
    - [x] ~~In 'Branches', the original lazygit has `<c-o>` to copy PR URL, we might already have this in the `y` menu but worth verifying the direct shortcut.~~ (Author check: so yeah we won't need this)

- [x] Improve the speeds still, very important for larger repos. Improve first-load speed. Either cache the data, or the render the TUI even before the git load model data isn't there yet. (perceived speed)
- [x] regular push behavior to essentially do `git push origin HEAD`

- [ ] Config-parity, make sure everything works.
- [ ] Hot reloading of config (I can edit the config on the fly and the config is still read without restarting lazygit)
- [x] Bug: in the diff exploration view, because of the 10s interval I think the position of which I scrolled at also seems to get reset. Ideally not. Just like how the [new] and [old] -- it used to have this bug but I fixed it.
- [x] Search feature inside the diff exploration view is much needed.
- [ ] Future: Grep for all in diff_mode is good too.
- [x] Search feature inside of diff mode. It works in the default view.
- [x] In `?` help dialog, use tui-textarea so I can erase the input using opt-backspace.
- [x] In 'Commit Files' view, in any, when I press `y`, it opens a Copy to clipboard dialog (same with other features). Some options I will see are: 'Copy filename', 'Copy old content', 'Copy new content'.

## Stuff I wanna do differently

- [x] Interactive Rebase should be more intuitive.
  - [x] I can see a commits list and then also see the commit it'll be merging into. Kinda exactly like VSCode's interactive rebase editor. https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/641685/102309169-31ba2a00-3f36-11eb-8b26-050c7d83fa3f.png but in TUI version. This could be a dialog on its own with its own focus groups. It'll look simpler and more interactive than the current lazygit.
    - Non-negotiables for me are:
      - I can press jk up down to switch between commits. I can h l left right to change the value to pick, squash, drop, edit.
      - The pick, drop, edit, squash options have semantic colors. The same w/ VSCode.
      - The node-like colors w/ indicators on the left side are great to have.
      - I can SEE the commit it'll rebase ontop of i.e. 'Hello GitLens' in this example.
      - I can see a 'Start Rebase' and an 'Abort' action.
- [x] Diff Mode / Compare Mode
  - Diff mode can be opened w/ a commad palette or when focusing on either BRANCH or COMMITS tab.
  - First trigger of it opening will open its own sort of screen that looks like:

    ```
    -------------------------------------------------------
    | A: ccf0183  | B: 09s8c90 |                          |
    ---------------------------- diff exploration view    |
    | Commit Files             |                          |
    |                          |                          |
    |                          |                          |
    |                          |                          |
    -------------------------------------------------------
    ```

    - So there's like an A and B comboboxes there. They can help you autosearch for a commit or a branch.
    -
    - You can obviously exit and go back to the default lazygit UI.
    - You can press tab to cycle focus between the A and B comboboxes, Commit Fles, and diff exploration view.
    - Commit Files and Diff Exploration View actually already exist if you notice. So as expected, they'd have the same hotkeys sort of. Especially diff exploration view like `[]` `{}`.

- [x] Pressing up or down in the commit messages, should cycle through previously submitted ones. Kinda like the up or down key in the commandline.
- [x] In '3 Branches' git checkout -.
- [x] In '3 Branches' git checkout by name. Pressing 'c'
- [x] In '3 Branches'. pressing d, opens a 'Delete branch ?' dialog, and I can see options:
  - c Delete local branch
  - r Delete remote branch
  - b Delete local and remote branch
  - And when I press 'c' to delete local branch, it asks me, 'branch' is not fully merged. Are you sure you want to delete it?
  - It also seems to be aware of the remote options so it strikethroughs if the remote is not there.. And the delete local and remote one.
- [x] In 'Files' when File Tree view is toggled on, in the original lazygit, there's a ▼ at the very root. I want that for our Files and Commit Files too.
- [x] In 'Files' show the diff for folders. We already have this for 'Commits' it shows a multifile diff preview.
- [x] In 'Files', pressing `i` shows a dialog, right now it immediately applies it.
- [x] In 'Branches', whichever is the 'checked-out' branch. Put it at the first of the list.

- [x] Diff view textwrapping.
- [x] Pressing 'e' to edit.
- [x] Pressing 'e' to edit w/ 'column'
- [x] Persist the ` file tree view setting.
- [x] Emit config commands in the 'Command Log'
- [x] Diff hunks now have offsetted line numbers.

- [x] Theming, like opencode style!

- [x] Make the combobox work with mouse (in diff_mode)
- [x] In diff_mode, show the 'current branch' as the first option.
- [x] ~~In 'Commits' view, pressing 'd' to drop a commit.~~ Just recommend using 'g' maybe?

- [x] Improve and standardize list-view mouse interaction behaviors:
  - Keyboard
    - Pressing down, Only start scrolling down when selected/cursor is on the last viewable element (I think this behavior is already behaved by all)
    - Pressing up, Only start scrolling up when the selected/cursor is already on the first viewable element (not followed by '2 Files', '3 Branches', '4 Commits', '5 Stash' etc. - currently even if I'm on the last element, it will still scroll up when I press up)
  - Mouse
    - Clicking a list item - just essentially skips cursor to select the item as the new selected/cursor. Shouldn't really imitate 'enter', it just changes the selection. Currently works in '2 Files' tab. i.e. 'Keybindings' (?), Interactive rebase (I), Checkout (c on branches), Color Theme.
    - Scroll down - ~~should have the same behavior as pressing down on any of the cmdk-style components~~ we decided later on that it has its own behavior, scroll down just scrolls the list view, does not change the selection.
    - Scroll up - ~~should have the same behavior as pressing up.~~ we decided later on that it has its own behavior, scroll up just scrolls the list view, does not change the selection.
    - [x] In shift- or shift+ (meaning the sizebar is in the only view...), mouse scroll does not work for the list views i.e. Commits, Branches, etc.
    - [x] New change, scrolling up/down with mouse isn't same behavior as pressing down or up. It just scrolls, but doesn't change the current selection. Let's do this!
    - [x] As of Apr 29, 2026 - noticed that this isn't the behavior of the 'Interactive Rebase' UI.

- [x] Subtab and sub-item menu mouse clicks should work, right now in sidebar, if I go to Branches, find main, press enter (now in commit files), I use my mouse and it goes back to 'Branches'. Maybe because mouseclicks currently on the sidebar usually always register for the root sub-item tab.

- [x] Loading state in 'actions' for dialogs i.e. Copy PR URL (just freezes the screen while it does the fetch call..., can we maybe add a loading without creating a separate dialog for it, just sort of a loading icon next to it when it's running). Some I can note of:
  - Copy PR URL
  - Open PR URL
  - Generate AI Commit Message (might be good, but honestly, I already liked what I did with it, so don't touch that.)

- [x] In 'remote branches' improvements and parity.
  - Just like in local branches, you always see the 'current branch' as the first item. Now here, we should be able to see that the first branch is the current branch item you see is the remote version of the current branch, if possible.
  - Currently in remote branches subtab, I can see the remotes connected to this repo... I can press 'enter' to see the branches, after that I can't really press 'enter' on any item on there anymore. Desired: I should be able to press 'enter' to subview visit into a 'branch' (to see commits), and then a 'commit' (to see files).. Just like in the local branches view.

- [x] When I do shift+enter while on the commit message body part... It's clearing what I typed instead of doing the same behavior as 'enter'. Weird. Expectation, it behaves like 'enter' as in creates a new line too.

- [x] Another keyboard improvement, when I press 'cmd+v' it doesn't actually paste in 1 frame. It seems to type what I had on my clipboard using the keyboard. so i.e. I pasted something really long, I see it sort of incrementing the text to that point instead of pasting it ' instantly'.

- [x] When Im on '3 Branches'. I want `y` to have an option to 'copy branch name'.

- [x] In '1 Status' I want to see details like
  - repo url (just origin remote, I think)
  - And 'contributors' - whichever is the cheapest way to get that data (i would personally refrain from traversing the entire commits history and get the contirbutors)
  - I want pressing y or o to work here as well.
    - The same ones I get from '3 branches' tab.

- [x] I tried passing a long 'web-1000-read-from-new-something-index-for-something-index' in 'new branch. Ended up having...
      web-1000-read-from-new-someth
      ng-index-for-something-indexi

  I think this is because of text wrapping for textarea inputs. But this is actually very annoying please fix. You feel like there's a better architecture for this maybe? + I feel like the 'text-wrapping' with the `\n` hack right now SHOULD NOT affect the actual output I gave (in case that isnt the behavior yet).. because I know we did essentially a 'hack' to make text inputs wrap the text within the widths of their input boxes with textarea.

  [x] Related: I also noticed, the text wrapping is only applied for when I type or paste. But not resize.
  - [x] Also noticed a major bug related to this... If I resize super small, the program crashes... thread 'main' panicked at (...) index outside of buffer: the area is Rect { x: 0, y: 0, width: 29, height: 38 } but index is (29,13)
        I also noticed for crashes like this (error not relevant ).. It shows the crash message right? But I cant actually stop the program anymore and just looks like whenever I move my mouse that: 35;1;18M35;1;18M35;2;18M35 (basically prints a bunch of those characters in the terminal making it unusable, that I have to close it)

- [x] Imitate Zed's 'diff' when it comes to listing it in anon-filetree format. it looks like (Image1) while currently it looks like lazygit's.
  - [x] I recently made a change in flat file view... 8c5c779c408cf0ff86e3a070733d442e7ce61f40 It affects '2 Files' tab. But I realized, I didn't make it affect the other 'Files' contexts i.e. 'Commit Files'. Or when I'm doing diff_mode's Commit Files'.

- [x] In '4 Commits' pressing `y` works, but inside of '3 Branches > (pressed enter, now in Commits)' pressing 'y' does not work. Can you check why and maybe if you can fix something about it? Also other parts where 'commits' are involved where `y` and `o` are useful in those contexts?

- [x] Quick good change about commit message modal. Like lazygit, let's not get rid of the current input when I press 'Esc' so that I won't lose progress even when I do that. But to make it convenient, add a 'Clear' option when I do ctrl+m so I won't need to manually erase the text inside all the 'Summary' and 'Description' textboxes.

- [x] I need that even though I'm focusing on 'Diff panel'.. I still want to be able to Shift+P.. So Shift+P (push), is like universal.

- [x] Fix: When I'm in cmdk dialogs i.e. 'Keybindings' (?), Checkout (c). cmd+v to paste does not work.

- [x] Feat: In 'Branches' when I 'checkout' search i.e. (c)... if I type `-` OR 'previous branch' OR 'prev branch', Instead of 'ref', let's show... 'Go to previous branch' (if it's possible to show the name of the actually previous branch (i.e. thinking just a command to check).. If it is, show something like '[-] Previous Branch (branch-name-here)'... but if it's too much of a pain to check for it, dont do it!)

- [x] Change 'Keybindings' panel (?) to 'Keybindings & Commands'. The only command we have currently is 'Color theme...' (change this to 'Color theme' only no ellipses).
  - Another useful command is

- [x] Flat file view. When I 'add' something, it reorders them in the list which is weird.

- [x] When we do shift-,shift+, we have Full View, Default View (as in not doing shift- or shift+), and Half View. When there's enough vertical space and the width is too small... Default View currently has a 'vertical' layout. Half View does not have a 'vertical' layout yet, so I want a vertical layout for half view.
- [x] The vertical layout has a minimum height it seems.

- [x] When '1 Status' is focused, since its height does not expand, it shows a lot of empty space under it. So when '1 Status' is focused, let's just expand the most important other tab (Files, Branches, Commits, or Stash)

- [x] cmdk dialog stuff (The 'Checkout branch', 'Interactive rebase current branch onto', 'Color theme' dialogs vs the `?` Keybindings dialog)... I found a point to make consistent...
  - The search highlight works for the first former.. But the latter (Keybindings dialog), it doesn't have search highlight. Meaning I type 'Vie', and I should see 'Vie' also highlighted in the search items for whatever matches. Similar to the others.

- [x] When I press `e` on a 'File' - before I press enter and focus the Diff Panel viewer. Meaning just on the Files tab and any other context related to 'Files'. It currently has the same behavior as pressing `o`. Instead, can we make `e` essentially do what we're doing with `e` in diff panel viewer, but pass the line&col params in there... But since we haven't really clicked yet and have no info on that... Let's make the line&col param as the line and col of the first changed hunk
  - [x] Also when focusing the diff viewer panel but no selection yet. Make `o` and `e` work, same behaviors as regular 'File'
  - [x] additionally, when we do `}` or `{` to jump around diffs, we kinda focus a different diff right? What if we made `e` also work with that as in sending the line:col combination so it's more seamless.

- [x] We already have Commit details when focusing commit items in their respective lists. This new change is ONLY related to full view (shift-). I initially made it show on the side.. But isntead, I decided to always make it show above. So now it'll be a vertical layout. THe half view, default view is just fine, no changes on that.

- [x] Make 'Graph View' a bit more compact, like lazygit/zed. I like the right-padding that the graph adds so it pushes the table to the right. Except that currently, if there's A LOT of branches. It becomes a problematic problem. So now, let's just make it a scrollable piece of kind of column with a max width. Might be not worth doing because Zed's terminal doesn't have horizontal mouse scroll.

- [x] Add a ✦ symbol as a button somewhere inside the 'Commit Message' dialog. This will be the special clickable button that will represent the 'Generate commit message' shortcut. Make it 'hoverable' with the mouse, show a tooltip when I hover on it 'c-g Generate w/ AI'.

- [x] multiselect commits in 'Commits' list ('4 Commits'). I wanna be able to 'squash'. In the original lazygit, I have these options when I'm focused on a commit item or range selected via `v`: squash, fixup, drop, edit, cherrypick, dismiss range select.
  - I think the current implementation is wayyy to unusable. Because why does it say 'Fixup commit <> into its parent?' that's very unclear. I think just do the following behavior...
    - The new s,f,d,e behavior (even when 1 or multirange select) in the '4 Commits' tab.
      The original lazygit behavior was for example... Press 's' to squash down - when I press it it shows a 'Are you sure you want to squash the selected commit(s) into the commit below?
    - But actually 1 big UX improvement over original lazygit is just immediately showing the 'Interactive Rebase' tool with it that kinda shows 'squash' for those commits you selected (or the single commit). And obviously it behaves like the regular way of pressing `i` or `I and then picking a ref and enter`. Basically it won't really commit the squash/fixup etc until you press enter.

- [x] Bug: Big bug with git hunks sometimes being misidentified.

- [x] Feat: add the author for interactive rebase on the commit we're 'rebasing on top of'. Currently when I try to rebase on top of a commit, the author is not visible in the list.

- [x] Fix: I can't press `enter` anymore in Commit Message > Description. But I can press `shift+enter`, please fix.

- [x] Weird bug when pressing space for "moved" (via git mv <>) — bulk stage/unstage on a folder passed the literal `"old -> new"` string as a git pathspec for renamed files, crashing `git add`. Also unstaging a rename only reset one half, leaving the other staged.

- [x] persist wrap in state.

- [x] While 'generating commit messages' or 'pushing' the UI is blocked. Let's not block it. Let us move around a bit. The question is.. where to put this indicator.

- [x] ~~Use 'check' and 'checkmark' for staged and unstaged (not like lazygit), more like zed.~~ (not planned)

- [x] Allow me to scroll using mouse the 'Commit Messages' dialog.

- [x] During interactive rebase UI, merge conflicts, I see a good UI for continuing and stuff. But I think when I press continue and the next commit on the list has a conflict. It just shows me the error dialog that there's a new conflict but does not update the new interactive rebase UI with the new progress on the next commit.

- [x] Performance optimizations for large repos, noticed, the performance sucked for Zed. Diff viewer was not the issue, i think it's just loading a lot in one go. Maybe paginate it. Partially fixed now, less laggy.
  - [x] But The issue now is that the graph is rendering too much because too many branches. but still usable, we just need to compact the graph or something

- [x] Add a "unified diff" view and a "side-by-side (split) diff view". Currently we only have split diff view by default. Let's give it a hotkey

- [x] See the other "remotes" added in 'status'. So that when 'Copy PR URL' is used, it can copy the PR Url on the "upstream" if the PR is actually there. Just fallback. For instance, I made a PR on /Users/carlo/Desktop/Projects/zed, I tried 'copy pr url' or 'open pr url' and just get empty, but in fact, I do have a PR in https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/58041. Idk if this needs some good proper configurators for `gh repo set-default` and stuff like that.

- [x] I'm in a repo. I `cd` to a subfolder in the repo. I get `<foldername> -> <branch>` which is not normal. the <foldername> should be the repository name.

- [x] On Wezterm, I did `config.enable_kitty_keyboard = true`, now cmd+left or cmd+right doesn't work anymore (for skipping to the first/last character on the current line). Idk if this is a wezterm problem I need to patch or just on the wezterm lua side. Currently still works on the Zed Terminal btw.

Also another thing I noticed, a missed keyboard behavior we didn't do yet... Doing cmd+backspace to clear from the current cursor. Not observed yet, even on the zed terminal. This is a mustfix.

Where I observed this behavior: I noticed this for the "Commit Message" and "Description". Generally where I can input text i..e the "Interactive rebase on" dialog palette or the help `?` command palette.

- [x] IN the original lazygit, When i delete tags, I can see a dialog with actions to delete local tag, delete remote tag, and 'delete local and remote tag'. Let's do that here as well.
  - [x] improvement, use the palette selector for branches and refs, find a way to reuse

- [x] Bug, I get rect whatever error when the error box shows up. My hypothesis is out of bounds or something.

- [x] Bug, git mv in non-filetree view and filetree view, broken and no diff.

- [x] Graph is still not good, the feature where it becomes a solid circle disappeared. But only for nodes that have like this connected + hexagon look.

- [x] `-` in '3 Branches' does not work

- [ ] hunk-like notes feature

- [x] in files list, show a `*2 +143 -71` on the justified end of the file item.
- [x] When doing shift+] and shift+[ (the diff exploration) on the diff view, give me a way to see the current "hunk block" that I'm reading in the top right with this indication: [1/5] meaning 1 out of 5 hunks.

- [x] Detached head.. When I'm making a commit. Like press 'c'. Immediately show a warning, but allow the action to continue anyway. Like 'You are in a detached head, not a branch. Are you sure you want to commit?' And it's just a simple yes or no alert.

- [x] Better cherry picks tips.
  - [x] 'C' currently says 'Cherry pick', but also say 'C Copy (cherry-pick)'.
  - [x] I can do 'C' to copy. Let me do see 'V Paste (cherry-pick)' in the tips and help `?`. It must be at the very beginning of tips. Make sure the alert says the branch it will put it onto (which I assume is always the currently checked-out branch - am I right?), not just "On this branch?" - because the user would kinda assume that it would be on the branch that their cursor hovered on.

- [ ] TBD (if I want to implement GitHub): tabs at the very top for: 'Git', 'Compare', 'Github'
  - [ ] Git is just the current
  - [ ] Compare is just the 'W' global key we already have
  - [ ] TBD: Github is just Kit Langton's `ghui` https://github.com/kitlangton/ghui rebuit in rust.

- [x] Resize the sidebar using mouse, click and drag.

- [x] in original lazygit, space in the '4 Commits' view actually isn't by default always entering the 'detached head' context. Most of the time (as long as you see the branch name in the list item, like if it's the item that's the head of that branch), it actually shows `l checkout branch '<branchname>'` as a second option and the first option is like `d checkout commit b838172 as detached head`

- [x] the \` key to toggle the tree view or the list view isnt persisted inside the "W" Compare tool. Seems like it's always list to start.

- [x] When deleting a remote tag (using 'delete remote tag' OR 'delete remote and local tag') that's on origin (it's a network request).. So show an async modal, instead of showing a "nothing changed" kinda UI. (add feedback)

- [x] Allow reword on empty commit (original lazygit allows this seamlessly)
- [x] When viewing a tag in the 'Tags' subtab in '3'. Add a `(main,origin)` label, or the other remotes as well like `(main,origin/main,someremote/main)` or something?

- [x] Optimize the "after pressing enter" when in commiting or rewording.

- [x] The `/` filtering needs better UI feedback. In the original lazygit, it highlights the chars that it matches with. But the scope affects a lot, so let's see if we can find a way to do this well.

- [x] If the new commit in `main` is super fresh.. The first time I do `p` Pull, throws an eror of 'divergent branches', but then the second time I run `p` and enter. it's okay.

- [ ] Checking out pull requests branches, by pressing space I think? `gh pr checkout` and also doing `P` or `p` from the pr head? I was thinking a bunhc of settings to do `P` and then see something like a a custom push command there like push to a different origin etc. Idk tbh what UX i want here.

- [x] IN filetree view, the "M" or "A" or "??" should be slightly more indented. in Files.. Because currently it's lesser indented than the ▶︎ characters, visually makes u think it's at the root, which is bad UX.

- [x] lazygitrs upgrade

- [x] Be able to fallback w/ confirm alert when "c" checkout a new branch that doesnt exist.

- [x] Improve filter performance (ctrl-s), more instantaneous, too slow right now

- [x] Unified diff when scrolling, sometimes some of the diff lines get cleared as I scroll

- [x] Interactive rebase 'e' bug. Points to older commit

- [x] Stability of commit message generation and their wrapping, consistent \n- is sometimes cleared in the body. this is definitely a wrapping problem in the UI
  - Root cause: `unwrap_commit_body` joined consecutive non-blank lines with spaces (`- a\n- b` → `- a - b`). Soft-wrap is now display-only; logical newlines from AI/paste/history are preserved. `WrapLayout` uses unicode display width (crabcode-style).
